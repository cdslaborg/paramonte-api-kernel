!
!   USAGE:
!
!       --  Comments must begin with an exclamation mark (!).
!       --  Comments can appear anywhere on an empty line or, after a value assignment.
!       --  All variable assignments are optional and can be commented out. In such cases, appropriate default values will be assigned.
!       --  Use ParaDRAM namelist (group) name to group a set of ParaDRAM simulation specification variables.
!       --  The order of the input variables in the namelist groups is irrelevant and unimportant.
!       --  Variables can be defined multiple times, but only the last definition will be considered as input.
!       --  All variable names are case insensitive. However, for clarity, this software follows the camelCase code-writing practice.
!       --  String values must be enclosed with either single or double quotation marks.
!       --  Logical values are case-insensitive and can be either .true., true, or t for a TRUE value, and .false., false, or f for a FALSE value.
!       --  All vectors and arrays in the input file begin with index 1. This is following the convention of 
!           the majority of science-oriented programming languages: Fortran, Julia, Mathematica, MATLAB, and R.
