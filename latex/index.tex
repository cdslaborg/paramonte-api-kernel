Para\+Monte is a serial / parallel library of Monte Carlo routines for sampling mathematical objective functions of arbitrary-\/dimensions, in particular, the posterior distributions of Bayesian models in data science, Machine Learning, and scientific inference, with the design goal of unifying the

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The Camel\+Case naming style is used throughout the entire Para\+Monte kernel library.
\item Although the Fortran language is case-\/insensitive, by convention, all scalar variable names begin with a lower case, whereas all vectors, arrays, types, and module names begin with an upper-\/case letter.
\item The name of any variable that represents a vector of values is normally suffixed with {\ttfamily Vec} or {\ttfamily Vector}, for example\+: {\ttfamily Start\+Point\+Vec}, ...
\item The name of any variable that represents a matrix of values is normally suffixed with {\ttfamily Mat}, for example\+: {\ttfamily proposal\+Start\+Cor\+Mat}, ...
\item The name of any variable that represents a list of varying-\/size values is normally suffixed with {\ttfamily List}, like\+: {\ttfamily variable\+Name\+List}, ...
\item All static functions or methods of classes begin with a lowercase verb.
\item Significant attempt has been made to end all boolean variables with a passive verb, such that the full variable name virtually forms a proposition, that is, an English-\/language statement that should be either {\ttfamily .true.} or {\ttfamily .false.}, set by the user.
