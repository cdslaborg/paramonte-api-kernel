 \doxysection*{\href{\#ParaMonteNamingConventions}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{ Para\+Monte Naming conventions  }} }} }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The {\bfseries{Camel\+Case}} naming style is used throughout the entire Para\+Monte kernel library.
\item {\bfseries{Variable naming conventions}}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Although the Fortran language is case-\/insensitive, by convention, all scalar variable names begin with a lower case, whereas all vectors, arrays, types, and module names commonly begin with an upper-\/case letter. This rule is not strictly imposed on the public interfaces of the library.
\item All constants and parameters should be generally typed upper-\/case entirely. For example, 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{fortran_statement}{use }\textcolor{fortran_inrinsic_module}{iso\_fortran\_env}, \textcolor{fortran_statement}{only}:\textcolor{fortran_named_const}{ real64}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{fortran_statement}{integer} ,\textcolor{fortran_attribute}{ parameter} :: RK\textcolor{fortran_operator_symbols}{ = }\textcolor{fortran_named_const}{real64}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{fortran_statement}{real}(RK),\textcolor{fortran_attribute}{ parameter} :: PI\textcolor{fortran_operator_symbols}{ = }\textcolor{fortran_function}{acos}(\textcolor{fortran_operator_symbols}{-\/}\textcolor{fortran_numeric_literal}{1.\_RK})}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item The names of variables that represent vectors of values can be suffixed with {\ttfamily Vec} or {\ttfamily Vector} (for example, {\ttfamily Proposal\+Start\+Std\+Vec}, ...) although, this is not recommended since it can conflict with generic programming. Use this naming convention only if the variable is to always represent a vector.
\item The names of variables that represent matrices of values can be suffixed with {\ttfamily Mat} or {\ttfamily Matrix} (for example\+: {\ttfamily Proposal\+Start\+Cor\+Mat}, ...) although, this is not recommended since it can conflict with generic programming. Use this naming convention only if the variable is to always represent a matrix.
\item The names of variables that represent lists of varying-\/size values can be suffixed with {\ttfamily List} (for example, {\ttfamily domain\+Axes\+Name\+List}, ...) although, this is not recommended since such naming can interfere with generic programming.
\item Significant attempt has been made to end all {\ttfamily logical} (boolean) variables with a passive verb, such that the full variable name virtually forms a proposition, that is, an English-\/language statement that should be either {\ttfamily .true.} or {\ttfamily .false.}, for example, {\ttfamily parallelism\+Mpi\+Finalize\+Enabled}.

Occasionally, names that begin with the verb {\ttfamily is} can be also used to label {\ttfamily logical} objects. But as a general rule, names that begin with a verb should be reserved for procedures.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Procedure naming conventions}}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Procedure (whether function, subroutine, or type-\/bound procedure (class method)) names should be descriptive of the action performed by the procedure. For example,
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily gen\+Cov\+Upp} means {\itshape generate (a) covariance upper(-\/triangular matrix)}.
\item {\ttfamily symmetrize\+Mat\+Upp} means {\itshape symmetrize (the input) matrix upper(-\/triangular)}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Procedure names should virtually always begin with a lower-\/case verb.
\item {\bfseries{Function naming conventions}}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Function names should preferably begin with {\ttfamily gen}. The reasoning is simple; Functions {\bfseries{gen}}erate objects of various types and return them. While it is equally possible to use other verbs to prefix function names, like {\ttfamily get}, such verbs should be reserved for the subroutine equivalents of the same functions. For example, {\ttfamily symmetrize\+Mat\+Upp} is a {\itshape subroutine} that symmetrizes the input upper-\/triangle matrix that has {\ttfamily intent(inout)}. Equivalently, the function {\ttfamily gen\+Mat\+Sym\+From\+Mat\+Upp(\+Mat\+Upp) result(\+Mat\+Sym)} generates a symmetric version of the input matrix and returns it as the function result.
\item Functions that return objects of type {\ttfamily logical} should be preferably prefixed with {\ttfamily is} or be named such that the name begins with a verb and reads as a proposition, evaluating to either {\ttfamily .true.} or {\ttfamily .false.}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Subroutine naming conventions}}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The keyword {\bfseries{{\ttfamily gen}}} should be avoided as a prefix for subroutine names since subroutines do not {\bfseries{gen}}erate any objects to return. Subroutines only manipulate and transform arguments passed to them.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Exceptions}} to the above rules are allowed when the procedure name is exceptionally famous or it is very inconvenient to prefix the procedure name with a verb.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Case-\/sensitivity}}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Although the Fortran programming language is case-\/\+INsensitive, please preserve and ensure the case-\/sensitivity compliance of all object names including module, type, procedure, and variable names in all codes and files. This is crucial for the proper hyper-\/linking of different HTML pages of the {\ttfamily Para\+Monte \+:: Kernel} developer library that you are reading right now, generated by Doxygen. For example, if the module name is {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceArray__mod}{Array\+\_\+mod}}}, do not write it in any other way like {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceArray__mod}{Array\+\_\+mod}}} or {\ttfamily ARRAY\+\_\+\+MOD}.
\item If a variable or procedure argument in a generic interface can be both scalar and array, it should be preferably capitalized since a scalar can be envisioned as particular case of an array with one element.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Clarity vs. conciseness}}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Always prefer clarity to conciseness, specially when choosing variable, argument, or procedure names.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Preprocessor MACRO conventions}}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item MACRO names, if they are to used as conditions in preprocessing directives, should always read like a proposition that evaluates to either true or false. For example, {\ttfamily CHECK\+\_\+\+ENABLED}, {\ttfamily IS\+\_\+\+WINDOWS}.
\item MACRO names, if they are to used as conditions, must be always given a value of {\ttfamily 1} if true. This is specially important if the macro is defined from within the source code. {\bfseries{Why?}} Such value assignment eliminates reliance of the conditional construct on the {\itshape definition} status of the macro as the condition. For example, the following conditional construct, 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{\#define CHECK\_ENABLED 1}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{}\textcolor{preprocessor}{\#if CHECK\_ENABLED}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{}    \textcolor{fortran_keywordflow}{if} (\textcolor{fortran_operator_logical}{.not.}\textcolor{fortran_function}{ present}(Err) \textcolor{fortran_operator_logical}{.and.} ChoDia(\textcolor{fortran_numeric_literal}{1})\textcolor{fortran_operator_symbols}{ < }\textcolor{fortran_numeric_literal}{0.\_RK})\textcolor{fortran_statement}{ error stop}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#endif}

\end{DoxyCode}
 executes because {\ttfamily CHECK\+\_\+\+ENABLED} is assigned a value of {\ttfamily 1}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Controlling the runtime checks}}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The Para\+Monte library has two different build modes (for any build type\+: {\ttfamily debug}, {\ttfamily testing}, {\ttfamily release}). The build mode is determined (by the choice of user) via the preprocessor flag {\ttfamily CHECK\+\_\+\+ENABLED}. If this macro is defined, then certain checks on procedure arguments and validity tests in various modules and procedures of the library are automatically performed at runtime to ensure the validity and accuracy of the calculations. This will however, lower the runtime performance of the library. As such, the Para\+Monte build scripts define the preprocessor macro {\ttfamily CHECK\+\_\+\+ENABLED} by default for the {\ttfamily debug} and {\ttfamily testing} build types, and undefine the macro for the {\ttfamily release} build. For any build type, this behavior can be overriden by the user/developer when building the library. Refer to the help file of the build scripts for more details and instructions. \begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
Do {\bfseries{NOT}} lower the case of any uppercase {\ttfamily PURE} procedure attribute. The uppercase {\ttfamily PURE} is a macro that expands to {\ttfamily pure} when runtime checks are disabled, that is, when {\ttfamily CHECK\+\_\+\+ENABLED} is undefined or set to {\ttfamily 0}, otherwise, it is empty. The worst consequence of failing to pay attention to this matter is that the library will not compile and the developer will have to fix any mistakes they have made with {\ttfamily PURE} preprocessor macros.
\end{DoxyWarning}

\item When the library is built with tests enabled, a number of fatal {\ttfamily error stop} statements are disabled in some procedures (like the Para\+Monte samplers), in particular, when the library is built in parallel mode. Such temporary disabling of global program halts is needed to ensure the error signals are propagated correctly with the library and across multiple processors. However, such extra testing communications (in particular, in parallel mode) can be very costly and therefore, {\bfseries{the library should never be built for production release with any tests of the library enabled}}.

\item {\bfseries{Doxygen custom command orderings}}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The Doxygen tag {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}brief} must always be the first line of the documentation of modules, types, and procedures. Example\+: \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceArray__mod}{Array\+\_\+mod}}.
\item The Doxygen tag {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}details}, if it exists, must always immediately follow the Doxygen tag {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}brief}. Example\+: \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceArray__mod}{Array\+\_\+mod}}.
\item The Doxygen tag {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}param}, if any number of it exists, must always immediately follow the Doxygen tag {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}brief} (or {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}details} if it exists). Example\+: \mbox{\hyperlink{interfaceSample__mod_1_1genMean}{gen\+Mean()}}.
\item The Doxygen tag {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}return}, must be exclusively used to indicate the return value of functions. If it exists, it must appear immediately after the set of {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}param} tags. Example\+: \mbox{\hyperlink{interfaceSample__mod_1_1genMean}{gen\+Mean()}}.
\item The Doxygen tag {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}warning}, if any number of it exists, must immediately follow the Doxygen tag {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}return} if it exists, otherwise {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}param} if it exists, otherwise {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}details} if it exists, otherwise {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}brief}. The {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}warning} tag must be used to highlight situations that require special attention of the user, otherwise, there is a danger for the code section being documented to not behave normally as one may expect.
\item The Doxygen tag {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}attention} has the same functionality and usage as {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}warning}. Therefore, {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}warning} should be preferred wherever {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}attention} is needed. Exceptions are allowed and if they occur, the same documentation conventions as those of {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}warning} also apply to the tag {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}attention}.
\item The Doxygen tag {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}remark}, if any number of it exists, must immediately follow the Doxygen tag {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}warning} if it exists, otherwise the Doxygen tag {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}return} if it exists, otherwise {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}param} if it exists, otherwise {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}details} if it exists, otherwise {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}brief}. The tag {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}remark} should be reserved for explaining behavior that is {\bfseries{directly}} related to the code segment being documented, but its knowledge is not so critical as warrant the use of a {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}warning} tag.
\item The Doxygen tag {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}remark}, if it exists, must appear after all {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}warning} and {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}remark} and {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}note} tags and immediately before the Para\+Monte custom command tag {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}usage} for examples (if it exists). If more than one {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}see} exists, each must reside a separate line. This can be done by inserting the HTML tag for the new line character {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}br\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} between the items. Example\+: See below.
\item If any example exists, it must appear immediately after the {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}see} tag, otherwise after {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}note}, {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}remark}, {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}warning}, {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}param}, {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}details}, or {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}brief} if any exists. Para\+Monte examples are initiated by the custom command {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}usage} devised in the {\ttfamily config.\+txt} file of Para\+Monte Doxygen documentation. If the example exists in an external file, then it must be included via the Doxygen {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}include} command, followed immediately by the Para\+Monte custom Doxygen command {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}compile} which inserts the generic example compile commands for the example, followed optionally but immediately by the output file of the example inserted in the documentation via the {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}include} command, followed immediately by the inclusion of any other visualization or postprocessing scripts and output. $\ast$$\ast$\+In all steps, it is imperative to not leave any empty lines between the successive commands of the example section, designated by the {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}usage}, otherwise, each empty line will start a new paragraph in the documentation. Example\+: See below.
\item The Doxygen {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}test} tag, if any exists, must appear immediately after the example section designated by the {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}usage} tag. The Doxygen {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}todo} tag, if any exists, must appear immediately after the {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}test} tag or any other tag immediately preceding it. The Doxygen {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}bug} tag, if any exists, must appear immediately after the {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}todo} tag or any other tag immediately preceding it.
\item The closing command of each documentation section must be the Para\+Monte custom command {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}final} separated from the tags before and after by an empty line.
\item The Doxygen {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}author} tag is the last command to appear in any documentation section, and it must preferably have the format exemplified in the example below. ~\newline

For an up-\/to-\/date list of all available aliases, check the value of the Doxygen {\ttfamily ALIASES} option in {\ttfamily config.\+txt}.
\item Avoid the insertion of an empty documentation line between any two lines of a single Doxygen paragraph. This is crucial when the whole paragraph is indented by a vertical line as is done by Doxygen for {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}warning}, {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}remark}, {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}note} and other similar tags.

\item \begin{DoxyParagraph}{Example usage}
The following is an example documentation for a procedure\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}!>  \brief
!>  Generate and return the variance of the input array of shape `(np)` or `(nd,np)` or `(np,nd)` where `nd` is the number of
!>  data dimensions (the number of data attributes) and `np` is the number of data points.
!>
!>  \param[in]  Sample  :   The input contiguous array of type `real` of kind \ RK32, \ RK64, or \ RK128 of shape `(np)`, `(nd,np)`, or `(np,nd)`
!>                          containing the sample. If `Sample` is a 2D array, then its shape is dictated by the optional input argument `dim`.
!>  \param[in]  Weight  :   The contiguous vector of shape `(np)` either type `real` of the same kind as the input `Sample` or type `integer`
!>                          of kind \ IK8, \ IK16, \ IK32, or \ IK64, containing the corresponding weight of each data points in `Sample`
!>                          (**optional**, default = a vector of ones).
!>  \param[in]  Mean    :   The input scalar or contiguous vector of shape `(nd)` of the same type and kind as the input `Sample` containing
!>                          the `Sample` mean along the (optionally) specified dimension `dim`. If the input `Sample` is a 1D array, then `Mean`
!>                          must be a scalar. Otherwise, if `Mean` is a 2D array, then `Mean` must be a vector whose size is the same as
!>                          the size of at least one of the dimensions of `Sample`.
!>                          (**optional**. If missing, then the input argument `shifted` must be present indicating whether the input `Sample`
!>                          is already centered at the origin or it has to be shifted to the origin by the procedure).
!>  \param[in]  shifted :   The input logical of default kind indicating whether the input `Sample` is already centered at the origin or
!>                          the it has to be shifted to the origin by the procedure (**optional**. If missing, then the input
!>                          argument `Mean` must be present).
!>  \param[in]  biased  :   The input logical of default kind indicating whether the output variance should be corrected for small sample-size
!>                          bias. Set this argument to `.false.` to avoid biased variance computation, in particular, when the sample size `np`
!>                          is small.
!>  \param[in]  dim     :   An integer of default kind \ IK indicating which dimension of the input `Sample` iterates over the individual data points.
!>                          If `dim = 1` or `dim /= 2`, the input `Sample` is assumed to have the shape `(np,nd)`.
!>                          If `dim = 2`, the input `Sample` is assumed to have the shape `(nd,np)`
!>                          (**optional**, default = `2`. **This input argument is available only if the input `Sample` is a 2D array**.).
!>
!>  \return
!>  `variance`          :   The output variance of the input sample of the same type and kind as the input `Sample`.
!>                          It is a scalar only if the input `Sample` is a 1D array. Otherwise, it is an allocatable array of shape `(nd)`.
!>
!>  \warning This procedure is `impure` when the library is compiled with macro `CHECK_ENABLED=1`. By default, it is `pure` in `release` build and `impure` in `debug` and `testing` builds.
!>
!>  \note
!>  One also use the concise Fortran syntax to achieve the same goal as this function:
!>  \code{fortran}
!>
!>       mean = sum(Weight*Sample) / sum(Weight)
!>       variance = sum( (Weight*(Sample-mean))**2 ) / (sum(Weight)-1)
!>
!>  \endcode
!>  But the above concise version will be slightly slower as it involves three loops instead of two.

 The above example documentation snippet will generate \mbox{\hyperlink{interfaceSample__mod_1_1genMean}{an HTML similar to this documentation}}. Note the lack of an empty line among the commands that immediately follow {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}usage}. This is essential to keep the entire example section in the same paragraph.
