\item Avoid the insertion of an empty documentation line between any two lines of a single Doxygen paragraph. This is crucial when the whole paragraph is indented by a vertical line as is done by Doxygen for {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}warning}, {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}remark}, {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}note} and other similar tags. Example\+: See the aforementioned tags in the example below.

The following is an example documentation for a procedure\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}      !>  \brief
      !>  Generate and return the variance of the input array of shape `(np)` or `(nd,np)` or `(np,nd)` where `nd` is the number of
      !>  data dimensions (the number of data attributes) and `np` is the number of data points.
      !>
      !>  \param[in]  Sample  :   The input contiguous array of type `real` of kind \RKALL of shape `(np)`, `(nd,np)`, or `(np,nd)`
      !>                          containing the sample. If `Sample` is a 2D array, then the direction along which the variance is computed
      !>                          is dictated by the optional input argument `dim`.
      !>  \param[in]  Weight  :   The contiguous vector of shape `(np)` either type `real` of the same kind as the input `Sample` or type `integer`
      !>                          of kind \IKALL, containing the corresponding weight of each data points in `Sample`
      !>                          (**optional**, default = a vector of ones).
      !>  \param[in]  Mean    :   The input scalar or contiguous vector of shape `(nd)` of the same type and kind as the input `Sample` containing
      !>                          the `Sample` mean along the (optionally) specified dimension `dim`. If the input `Sample` is a 1D array, then `Mean`
      !>                          must be a scalar. Otherwise, if `Mean` is a 2D array, then `Mean` must be a vector whose size is the same as
      !>                          the size of at least one of the dimensions of `Sample`.
      !>                          (**optional**. If missing, then the input argument `shifted` must be present indicating whether the input `Sample`
      !>                          is already centered at the origin or it has to be shifted to the origin by the procedure).
      !>  \param[in]  shifted :   The input logical of default kind indicating whether the input `Sample` is already centered at the origin or
      !>                          the it has to be shifted to the origin by the procedure (**optional**. If missing, then the input
      !>                          argument `Mean` must be present).
      !>  \param[in]  biased  :   The input logical of default kind indicating whether the output variance should be corrected for small sample-size
      !>                          bias. Set this argument to `.false.` to avoid biased variance computation, in particular, when the sample size `np`
      !>                          is small.
      !>  \param[in]  dim     :   An integer of default kind \IK indicating which dimension of the input `Sample` iterates over the individual data points.
      !>                          If `dim = 1` or `dim /= 2`, the input `Sample` is assumed to have the shape `(np,nd)`.
      !>                          If `dim = 2`, the input `Sample` is assumed to have the shape `(nd,np)`
      !>                          (**optional**, default = `2`. **This input argument is available only if the input `Sample` is a 2D array**.).
      !>
      !>  \return
      !>  `variance`          :   The output variance of the input sample of the same type and kind as the input `Sample`.
      !>                          It is a scalar only if the input `Sample` is a 1D array. Otherwise, it is an allocatable array of shape `(nd)`.

      !>  \note
      !>  One also use the concise Fortran syntax to achieve the same goal as this function:
      !>  \code{fortran}
      !>
      !>       mean = sum(Weight*Sample) / sum(Weight)
      !>       variance = sum( (Weight*(Sample-mean))**2 ) / (sum(Weight)-1)
      !>
      !>  \endcode
      !>  But the above concise version will be slightly slower as it involves three loops instead of two.

 The above example documentation snippet will generate an HTML similar to this documentation. Note the lack of an empty line among the commands that immediately follow {\ttfamily \textbackslash{}example}. This is essential to keep the entire example section in the same paragraph.
