Return a matrix resulting from the multiplication of the input {\ttfamily facupp} with the upper triangle of the input square matrix and {\ttfamily faclow} with the lower triangle of the input matrix and {\ttfamily facdia} with the diagonal elements of the input matrix.  




\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Return a matrix resulting from the multiplication of the input {\ttfamily facupp} with the upper triangle of the input square matrix and {\ttfamily faclow} with the lower triangle of the input matrix and {\ttfamily facdia} with the diagonal elements of the input matrix. 

This function is a shortcut to avoid writing loops for multiplying the upper and lower triangles and diagonal of a matrix by some given factors. While writing the loop is simple, since it occurs frequently, this function provides a cleaner solution.


\begin{DoxyParams}[1]{Parameters}
\mbox{\texttt{ in}}  & {\em Matrix} & \+: The square matrix whose elements shall be all reals of either {\ttfamily RK32}, {\ttfamily RK64}, {\ttfamily RK128} kinds. \\
\hline
\mbox{\texttt{ in}}  & {\em facupp} & \+: The factor by which the upper triangle of the input matrix will be multiplied. It must be a real of the same kind as that of {\ttfamily Matrix} ({\bfseries{optional}}, default = {\ttfamily 1.}). \\
\hline
\mbox{\texttt{ in}}  & {\em faclow} & \+: The factor by which the lower triangle of the input matrix will be multiplied. It must be a real of the same kind as that of {\ttfamily Matrix} ({\bfseries{optional}}, default = {\ttfamily 1.}). \\
\hline
\mbox{\texttt{ in}}  & {\em facdia} & \+: The factor by which the diagonal elements of the input matrix will be multiplied. It must be a real of the same kind as that of {\ttfamily Matrix} ({\bfseries{optional}}, default = {\ttfamily 1.}).\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
{\ttfamily Scaled\+Matrix} \+: The output matrix whose upper/lower triangles and diagonals result from multiplication of the corresponding input factors ({\ttfamily facupp}, {\ttfamily faclow}, {\ttfamily facdia}) with the upper/lower triangles and diagonals of the input {\ttfamily Matrix}.
\end{DoxyReturn}
\begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
The input matrix must be square. This condition is checked only when the preprocessor macro {\ttfamily CHECK\+\_\+\+ENABLED} evaluates to true.

This procedure is {\ttfamily impure} when the library is compiled with macro {\ttfamily CHECK\+\_\+\+ENABLED=1}. By default, it is {\ttfamily pure} in release build and {\ttfamily impure} in {\ttfamily debug} and {\ttfamily testing} builds.
