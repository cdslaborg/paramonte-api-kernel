Return the {\bfseries{upper triangle}} covariance matrix of the input shifted, optionally-\/weighted, sample {\ttfamily Shifted\+Sample} whose shape is by default assumed to be {\ttfamily (nd,np)} or {\ttfamily (nd,np)} such that {\ttfamily nd \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<} np} always holds, where {\ttfamily nd} represents the number of attributes (dimensions) of the sample and {\ttfamily np} represents the number of data points in the sample. Note that by definition, {\ttfamily np \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} nd} must hold. The input sample must be normalized in the sense that its mean is zero.  




\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Return the {\bfseries{upper triangle}} covariance matrix of the input shifted, optionally-\/weighted, sample {\ttfamily Shifted\+Sample} whose shape is by default assumed to be {\ttfamily (nd,np)} or {\ttfamily (nd,np)} such that {\ttfamily nd \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<} np} always holds, where {\ttfamily nd} represents the number of attributes (dimensions) of the sample and {\ttfamily np} represents the number of data points in the sample. Note that by definition, {\ttfamily np \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} nd} must hold. The input sample must be normalized in the sense that its mean is zero. 


\begin{DoxyParams}[1]{Parameters}
\mbox{\texttt{ in}}  & {\em Shifted\+Sample} & \+: The contiguous array of real type of kind \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceConstants__mod_aaf5c6c840ed0befe5a37da626c35716f}{RK32}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceConstants__mod_a855643f887b4c787e6542e9e7849680f}{RK64}}, or \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceConstants__mod_aeef7c44b90b75aeeebdef1da504886cb}{RK128}} of shape {\ttfamily (\+:,\+:)} containing the sample. The input sample must be shifted such that its mean is the origin (zero). If needed, the sample can be shifted by computing its mean via \mbox{\hyperlink{interfaceSample__mod_1_1genMean}{gen\+Mean()}} and passing it together with the sample to either \mbox{\hyperlink{interfaceSample__mod_1_1getShifted}{get\+Shifted()}} or \mbox{\hyperlink{interfaceSample__mod_1_1genShifted}{gen\+Shifted()}} to shift the sample toward the origin. \\
\hline
\mbox{\texttt{ in}}  & {\em Weight} & \+: The contiguous array of shape {\ttfamily (\+:)} of type integer of default kind \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceConstants__mod_a2bf4d6767c9954d3a495d10ab6b538d6}{IK}} or real of kind \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceConstants__mod_aaf5c6c840ed0befe5a37da626c35716f}{RK32}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceConstants__mod_a855643f887b4c787e6542e9e7849680f}{RK64}}, or \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceConstants__mod_aeef7c44b90b75aeeebdef1da504886cb}{RK128}} containing the sample weights. The length of {\ttfamily Weight} must match the length of {\ttfamily Shifted\+Sample} along its longest axis. For example, if {\ttfamily Shifted\+Sample} has shape {\ttfamily (nd,np)} and {\ttfamily np \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} nd}, then {\ttfamily Weight} must have the shape {\ttfamily (np)} ({\bfseries{optional}}, default = {\ttfamily 1}, that is, all points in the sample have equal weights).\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
{\ttfamily Cov\+Upp} \+: The upper triangle of the covariance matrix of shape {\ttfamily (nd,nd)} of the input normalized sample. The type and kind of the output array are the same as that of the input {\ttfamily Shifted\+Sample}.
\end{DoxyReturn}
\begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
This procedure is {\ttfamily impure} when the library is compiled with macro {\ttfamily CHECK\+\_\+\+ENABLED=1}. By default, it is {\ttfamily pure} in {\ttfamily release} build and {\ttfamily impure} in {\ttfamily debug} and {\ttfamily testing} builds.
\end{DoxyWarning}
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
If the full symmetric covariance matrix is needed, it can be obtained by passing the output of this procedure to the subroutine \mbox{\hyperlink{interfaceMatrix__mod_1_1symmetrizeMatUpp}{Matrix\+\_\+mod\+::symmetrize\+Mat\+Upp()}}.
